## üöÄ **IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS**

### Step 1: Quick Functionality Test
Let's start with a quick test of the main features:

1. **Test API Documentation Tab**
   - Navigate to API Docs tab
   - Click Swagger UI link - verify it opens
   - Click ReDoc link - verify it opens
   - Test a few API calls in Swagger UI

2. **Test Advanced Search**
   - Go to Advanced Search tab
   - Add some filters (contractors, areas, etc.)
   - Verify search results load
   - Test export functionality

3. **Test Data Explorer**
   - Go to Data Explorer tab
   - Switch between different dimensions
   - Verify analytics data loads
   - Test export functionality

### Step 2: Remove Legacy Code
- Remove the unused `advanced-search` endpoint
- Update API documentation to remove it

### Step 3: Final Documentation Update
- Update all documentation to reflect final state
- Ensure all examples are accurate

## üìã **TESTING SCENARIOS**

### Critical User Flows
1. **Search ‚Üí Filter ‚Üí Export Flow**
   - Search for contracts with filters
   - Verify results are accurate
   - Export data and verify CSV content

2. **Analytics ‚Üí Drill-Down ‚Üí Export Flow**
   - View analytics data
   - Drill down into specific entities
   - Export aggregated data

3. **API Documentation ‚Üí Test API Flow**
   - Open Swagger UI
   - Test a few endpoints
   - Verify responses match documentation

### Edge Cases
1. **Empty Results**
   - Search with filters that return no results
